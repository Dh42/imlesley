If you are familiar with me, you know that I work from an office in my home. I have an awesome commute, but it gets boring looking at the same walls every day. So lately I have started picking up more hobbies. 

The newest hobby is trying my hand at growing things. I bought some succulents at first, which I have managed to keep alive for several months.
