If you are familiar with me, you know that I work from an office in my home. I have an awesome commute, but it gets boring looking at the same walls every day. So lately I have started picking up more hobbies. 

The newest hobby is trying my hand at growing things. I bought some succulents at first, which I have managed to keep alive for several months.

So far they seem to be doing well. I am not an expert, but at least they are not dead yet. Trying my hand at the succulents made me want to branch out even more. I decided to start a garden this year and try growing some of my own food and spices. 

I searched around online and bought a ton of seeds from several different vendors, so I could start the seeds indoors, to have plants to plant when the weather warmed up. For the most part this worked pretty well. Almost all of the seeds I planted germinated and started to grow.

This is only a small fraction of what germinated, I have a feeling I went a bit overboard. 

So far what I have sprouting is:

* Green Zebra Tomatoes
* Dark Galaxy Tomatoes
* Black Krim Tomatoes
* Pink Brandywine Tomatoes
* Cherokee Purple Tomatoes
* Atomic Grape Tomatoes
* Get Stuffed Tomatoes

And for peppers

* Aji Charapita
* Brazilian Starfish
* Carolina Reapers
* Apocalypse Scorpions
* Paprika
* Manganji

And spices

* Cilantro
* Lemon Cilantro
* Oregano
* Large Leaf Basil
* Lime Basil


I know, its a bit overboard, but I cannot wait to see how things make it in the garden, that I have still yet to build. I guess the beds for the garden will be another post.
